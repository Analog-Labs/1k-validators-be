## :wave: Introduction

The Thousand Validators Programme is an initiative by Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies to use the funds held by both organizations to nominate validators in the community.

### How it Works 

The nominating backend will routinely change its nominations at every era. The backend does this by short-listing candidates by validity and then sorts validators by their weighted score in descending order. Validators with a higher weighted score are selected for any possible slots. As validators are nominated and actively validate, their weighted scores decrease, allowing other validators to be selected in subsequent rounds of assessment. If a validator is active during a single nomination period (the time after a new nomination and before the next one) and does not break any of the requirements, it will have its rank increased by 1. Validators with higher rank have performed well within the program for a longer period of time. The backend nominates as many validators as it reasonably can in such a manner to allow each nominee an opportunity to be elected into the active set.
